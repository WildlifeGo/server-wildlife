# Project Title

Wildlife Go! A pokemon-inspired species-finder game.

## Description

This is a mobile game that uses iNaturalist API and Google Maps API to talk to each other. When that happens we display 5 animals on the game screen that have been spotted by nature enthusiast at the location chosen by the user. It's a seattle based app, so we have have chosen 5 parks in the area to be hard coded and displayed on the home-page as choiced, but we also have an input field that allows the user to type in any location in the world. 
After the species have been displayed, the user can go ahead and try to find them, check them off in the app. On completion the user is presented with pesonal stats of anuimals spotted.
